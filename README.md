GD.A1 
The digital image processing and deep learning techniques are considerably applied in the field of microbiology, and it has a countless perspective. Counting microorganism colonies in petri dishes through the necked eye is a time-consuming and slow process. Therefore, the need for a colony enumeration system that counts all colonies and also discriminates against green colonies is the key concern. Counting only green colour in cell profiler through the image processing method is wide area of interest in micro biological estimation, so in Python, a simple algorithm is frim-up to aid in visual discrimination. Thus, it can be concluded that enumeration of microorganisms can be performed automatically and reliably and become easier with the developed GD.A1 software.
